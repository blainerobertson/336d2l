		<h1>Peer Review</h1>
		<p>A peer review is exactly what it sounds like, a review of your dynamic project by another member of the class. The review would be conducted using the same grading matrix that will be used to assess the dynamic project.</p>

		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>By having another class member look at your site, they may catch errors or find items that are confusing. By providing you feedback on these items it gives you an opportunity to make corrections before the project is actually graded.</p>

		<h2>When?</h2>
		<p>Your project should be close to being complete. Therefore, it is recommended that the review be done within 72 hours of when the project is due. That gives you time to make corrections but not so far in advance that the project is not close to being done.</p>

		<h2>How?</h2>
		<p>Over the semester you have hopefully developed trust and relationships with your peers in the class. Approach several (2 is recommended) members of the class and ask them to swap reviews with you. Then, using the <a href="dyn_project_grading_matrix.html" target="_blank" title="Review the grading matrix">grading matrix</a> they review your project and you review theirs. After the review you give them your results and they do the same. You then carefully examine their reviews of your project and make corrections as needed.</p>

		<h2>Benefit</h2>
		<p>By having another pair of eyes review your project they will see things that you will not. By finding and pointing out errors, ommissions or confusing operations you can make fixes and better your grade when things are assessed by the professor.</p>
