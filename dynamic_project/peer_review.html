				<h1>Peer Review</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>A peer review is exactly what it sounds like, a review of your dynamic project by another member of the class. The review would be conducted using the same grading matrix that will be used to assess the dynamic project.</p>

				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>By having another class member look at your site, they may catch errors or find items that are confusing. By providing you feedback on these items it gives you an opportunity to make corrections before the project is actually graded.</p>

				<h2>When?</h2>
				<p>Your project should be close to being complete. Therefore, it is recommended that the review be done within 72 hours of when the project is due. That gives you time to make corrections but not so far in advance that the project is not close to being done.</p>

				<h2>How?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><span>Students will select their own peer reviewers from the class, it is suggested that you arrange yourselves into groups of 3.</span></li>
					<li><span>You are required to review the dynamic project of at least 2 of your peers and likewise receive at least 2 peer reviews of your own project.</span></li>
					<li><span>Be sure to coordinate between yourselves to insure that everyone receives the 2 required peer reviews.</span></li>
					<li><span>Use the <a href="dyn_project_grading_matrix.html" target="_blank">Dynamic Project Grading Matrix</a></span><span>&nbsp;to conduct the review of each project.</span></li>
					<li>In a word processing document:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Record the name of the person for whom you are doing the review</li>
						<li>Record the URL of where the project is found</li>
						<li>Create a list of the six objectives and a score (from the grading matrix) for each objective</li>
						<li>Provide comments about strengths and weaknesses of the project and issues found during your review.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Complete all peer reviews (2 total) prior to submitting them to the dropbox in this week's folder.</li>
					<li>Make sure you label each review document using the developer's name.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Benefit</h2>
				<p>By having another pair of eyes review your project they will see things that you will not. By finding and pointing out errors, ommissions or confusing operations you can make fixes and better your grade when things are assessed by the professor.</p>
