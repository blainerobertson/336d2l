				<h1>Dynamic Project FAQ</h1>
				<hr />
				<p>The Dynamic Project is where you decide how you will demonstrate your mastery of the concepts, skills, and techniques learned in this course. Use this Discussion Board to post questions and insights pertaining to the project in order to help one another plan, build, and complete the Dynamic Project.</p>
				<h2>Event Timeline</h2>
				<p><strong>Today</strong> - Begin thinking about a project that you would like to do, that is web based, that you could build for the dynamic project. Right now it will probably be vague, but as the course progresses, begin to firm up your ideas. Review the <a href="../dynamic_project/dynamic_project_description.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dynamic project requirements</a> now so you can begin thinking about it.</p>
				<p><strong>Week 08</strong>&nbsp;- Your project proposal is due as a word processing document. You will submit your proposal using the I-Learn submission tool to your teacher. The <a href="../dynamic_project/dynamic_project_description.html#proposal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criteria for the proposal</a> should be carefully reviewed to make sure your proposal is accurate and complete.</p>
				<p><strong>Week 13</strong> - Two <a href="peer_review.html" title="Read about the peer reviews">peer reviews</a> should be done by other members of the class in order to catch errors and provide you feedback prior to the project being due.</p>
				<p><strong>Week 14</strong> - The dynamic project is due for teacher assessment. Make sure your project meets the criteria by <a href="../dynamic_project/dyn_project_grading_matrix.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">carefully reviewing the grading matrix</a> in advance.</p>
