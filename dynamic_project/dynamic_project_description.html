				<h1>Dynamic Project</h1>
				<h2 id="requirements">Project Requirements</h2>
				<p>The dynamic project is <b>the major project</b> of the semester and is representative of all topics and objectives of the course. Use of M-V-C architecture of you own creation is required (frameworks created by others and use of exercises, enhancements or exam code from the textbook are not allowed). The project must include all of the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>At least one PHP controller for logic processing;</li>
					<li>At least one PHP model for database interactions;</li>
					<li>Valid and semantic HTML5 views styled with valid CSS3;</li>
					<li>Use custom functions to facilitate common code processes;</li>
					<li>Use all four CRUD data processes involving the database;</li>
					<li>Incorporate server and client-side data validation to protect the database and insure correct data submission;</li>
					<li>Use the PDO library and prepared statements for database interactions within the model;</li>
					<li>Use a database of your own design and construction for data storage.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="proposal">Project Proposal</h2>
				<p>The scope and functionality of the project will be determined by you and described in an application proposal. The project must demonstrate your mastery of building a dynamic web-based application. The proposal must thoroughly describe the application to be built, including:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>what the application will do;</li>
					<li>how the application meets the requirements listed above;</li>
					<li>a list and description of each controller, model and view.</li>
					<li>provide entity diagrams (see Ch. 16 or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fQ-bRllhXc" title="Watch the video on entity diagrams" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fQ-bRllhXc</a>) of the database(s), tables and fields to be used.</li>
					<li>be typed, double-spaced, in a word processing document.</li>
					<li>be submitted to the professor during the 8th week of the semester.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Professor response will be in one of the following forms:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><b>Approved</b> – you may proceed with the application project as proposed.</li>
					<li><b>Modify</b> – you must make modifications to the proposal as indicated and resubmit the modified proposal to the professor.</li>
					<li><b>Denied</b> – the project does not meet the requirements or is too large or small of scope. You must submit a new proposal.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 id="video">Project Video</h2>
				<p>The finished project is due as specified in the class documentation by being posted to your website and obviously and easily found on the site. <b>In addition</b>, you must post a video demonstrating the use of the project. The video must accomplish three tasks:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>How the project application operates</li>
					<li>How the application meets the project requirements, including an overview of the code written</li>
					<li>How the application fulfills you project proposal</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Video Software</h3>
				<p>You may use any video tool you choose, but several free tools for screencast captures are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href='http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/' title='Visit their site to learn more about screencast-o-matic'>Screencast-O-Matic</a> - 15 minute movie length; mp4, FLV or AVI format (recommended)</li>
					<li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cikPXK0ttzI' title='Learn how to use Google Hangout to record video'>Google Hangouts</a> - Saved to YouTube</li>
					<li><a href="https://youtu.be/hKQArshI904" target="_blank" title="View a video on creating a video using Quicktime Player">Quicktime Player</a> - Screencasts or movie capture </li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Project Options</h2>
				<p>A list of options is <b>NOT</b> provided on purpose. It is my desire to allow you to explore and think about ways you can implement these concepts on your own. Remember that you can propose anything that you believe meets the requirements listed above.</p>

				<h2 id="readings">Optional Readings</h2>
