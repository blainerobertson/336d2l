				<h1>Unit 2 Exam</h1>
				<h2>Directions</h2>
				<p><i>You may use any resource except another person to complete this exam.</i></p>
				<h3>Get the Seed Code</h3>
				<p><a href="../downloads/tech_support.zip" target="_blank">Download the seed code</a>.</p>
				<h3>Create the Database</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a &lsquo;tech_support&rsquo; database in both the remote and local environments as done with the guitar database in Chapter 3. Alter the name as needed to work.</li>
					<li>You may reuse the existing proxy user with the new database in both environments, and the same rights should exist with the new database: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.</li>
					<li>Import the tables and data using the sql file provided in the downloaded seed code.</li>
					<li>You will need a database connection file with a connection to the new database. Test that it works.</li>
					<li>In the product_register controller, reference the database connection file with the new connection created in step 4 above.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Set up the Work Space</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>In the local environment, copy the tech_support folder from the download file to a location in the htdocs folder. All work should be performed here.</li>
					<li>It is vital that you complete the exam in the local environment and then upload and thoroughly test the finished application in the production environment.</li>
					<li><b>There should be no link to the exam on your web site</b>. The exam should be accessed only by typing &ldquo;tech_support&rdquo; at the end of your URL.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
				<p>You&rsquo;ll create an application that allows a customer to register a product. The products and customers already exist in the database. To successfully complete this exam, you will:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a &ldquo;Login&rdquo; page that requires a customer to enter a valid email address prior to being able to register a product. See &ldquo;Login page&rdquo; below. [This is not a true login. The customer will have to pass through this page for each product registration and enter their email address each time.]</li>
					<li>Having passed through the login page, the customer can register a product without having to enter her or his name into the form, their name is captured and inserted into the register product form based on the login. See the &ldquo;Register Product view 1&rdquo; page below.</li>
					<li>Store the registration information in the registrations table.</li>
					<li>When the registration is complete, deliver a confirmation. See &ldquo;Register Product view 2&rdquo; below.&nbsp;</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 id="implementation">Implementation Expectations</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>The applications will be written using an M-V-C approach.</li>
					<li>All incoming data will be checked and filtered against malicious inputs.</li>
					<li>PDO will be used for PHP to database interactions.</li>
					<li>PDO prepared statements will be used when interacting with the database using PHP.</li>
					<li>Follow the operation / specification requirement listed below each of the page illustrations; these are the requirements for the specific page.</li>
					<li>Refer to the comments in the various views, models, and controllers provided in the seed code for additional information.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4><i>The Customer Login page</i></h4>

				<h3>Operation</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The "login" page should automatically load when the product registration link is clicked.</li>
					<li>To log in, the customer can enter his or her email address and click on the Login button.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><i>The Register Product page (view 1)</i></h4>
				<p class="Figuregraphic"><img src="../images/336unit2regview1.png" border="0" alt="Register product page (view 1) of the CIT 336 Unit 2 exam" title="Register product page (view 1) of the CIT 336 Unit 2 exam" width="825" height="404" /></p>
				<h3>Operation</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>To register a product, the customer can select the product and click on the Register Product button.</li>
					<li>The customer name must be pre-populated and be non-editable in the registration form.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Specifications</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The Product drop-down list should include all products. If you have any trouble with this, look ahead to figure 7&ndash;5 in Chapter 7 and figure 8&ndash;11 in Chapter 8.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><i>The Register Product page (view 2)</i></h4>
				<p><img src="../images/336unit2regview2.png" border="0" alt="Registration view illustration for the unit 3 exam" title="Registration view illustration for the unit 3 exam"></p>
				<h3>Operation</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>The user should only be allowed to register a product once per email address. After the customer clicks on the Register Product button, the application displays a message that indicates that the product was registered successfully or not. This message should include the product&rsquo;s code.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Follow the directions in the &ldquo;Set up the Work Space&rdquo; section above.</li>
					<li>When done, submit your code for review to the Unit 2 Exam Code Submission dropbox.</li>
					<li><b>The code for the Unit 2 Exam must be submitted for professor review as a zip file. </b>
						<ol>
							<li>Locate and zip the folder containing the code for the exam.</li>
							<li>Be sure the zip file name includes your name: e.g. Exam2-JohnSmith.zip.</li>
							<li>Submit the file to the dropbox in this week's module.</li>
						</ol>
