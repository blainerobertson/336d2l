<h1>Lesson 01 Notes</h1>
<hr />
<p>Before the week begins, become familiar with the topics and tutorials covered this week. You may want to email your students to introduce yourself. Once the week begins, be ready to help students in working with their hosting account, installing and configuring the various tools, signing up for a teaching presentation and registering their domain name in the site registration wiki. Most students should already be familiar with the primary development tools as they are the same as used in the CIT 230 course. However, with the installation of the XAMPP local development environment the tool configuration will be different than what they experienced in the 230 course. Before the start of lesson&nbsp;one, be certain that you are familiar with the grading strategies used in this course as it is different than in many courses. All grading is based on course objectives.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>If students have taken the CIT 230 course they may ask if they can re-purpose their 230 sites for this class. You can allow students to reuse past projects from CIT 230 or start from scratch.</p>
