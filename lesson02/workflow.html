		<h1>Development Workflow</h1>
		<p>A general confusion seems to be expressed in this question, "How do I develop and test my site locally and then get it out for the world to see?" The answer is to follow a work flow. In our situation we have a local server (XAMPP), an IDE (NetBeans), an FTP client (FileZilla) and a production server (your web hosting account). How do all of these work together to get the job done?</p>

		<p>The video below demonstrates how this happens. Please watch it carefully and perhaps even follow along to make sure it works for you too.</p>
