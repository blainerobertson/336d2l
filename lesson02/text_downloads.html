		<h1>Download Text Materials</h1>
		<h2>DOWNLOAD</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Download the chapter and exercise files for the text.</li>
			<li>Unzip the downloaded file.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Contents</h2>
		<p>The unzipped folder should be named "murach_files".</p>
		<p>Open the folder. There should be 3 sub-folders:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>book_apps — Contains the files and code found in the book chapters.</li>
			<li>ex_starts — Contains the starting files for the end of chapter exercises.</li>
			<li>ex_solutions — Contains the solutions to the end of chapter exercises.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Copy to htdocs</h2>
		<p>In setting up the tools for the course you should have an "htdocs" folder for your local development environment. This local environment is the perfect location to place files in order to do the chapter work, exercises and enhancements.</p>

		<p>As needed, copy the individual chapter or exercise folder into the homework folder on your machine. Then open NetBeans and begin working.</p>

		<h2>Testing</h2>
		<p>Be sure to test your work in the production server as well. To do so, upload the files to your remote host and test it live in your browser.</p>
