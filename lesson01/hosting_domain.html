		<h1>Site Hosting &amp; Domain Name</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Buying a domain name and site hosting will be the necessary for course success and gaining experience in being able to produce web-based materials and make them available to the world.</p>

			<p>It is strongly recommended that at this point you buy a generic domain name -&nbsp;your own name is suggested. Later, after you have gained experience and are ready to produce specific sites you can purchase more meaningful domain names.&nbsp;<b><i>If you have an active domain name and hosting from a previous course, you are welcome to keep and use it.</i></b></p>

			<p>Please insure that wherever you use that your hosting meets the requirements below.</p>
			<p><b>Hosting Requirements</b></p>
			<p>You are responsible for acquiring a domain name and professional web hosting from a provider of your choice. Previous students have had success with these companies:&nbsp;<a href="http://stats.justhost.com/track?c31b8be21a8ea1de7516b3cb569c3210e" target="_blank">JustHost.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hostmonster.com/track/blainerobertson/tellmemore?page=tell_me_more.html" target="_blank">Hostmonster.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/UP/BYUI" target="_blank">Bluehost.com</a>&nbsp;(each of these hosting companies provide a free domain name with purchased hosting).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Linux-based</li>
				<li>PHP 5.5 or greater support</li>
				<li>subdomains supported</li>
				<li>live customer support provided</li>
				<li>hosting must be maintained for the entire duration of the semester</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If in doubt that a host provider supports these criteria, contact the provider and ask. Do NOT assume that it does. All of the host providers mentioned in this document meet the requirements.</p>

		<h2>Go For It</h2>


			<p>The duration of your site hosting must last the full semester and the requirements for your hosting are listed above. Go to your selected host provider&rsquo;s web site and buy your hosting and domain name.</p>

			<p>After buying your hosting and domain name, the provider should send you an email with all the important information you will need for your account. Keep the email and write down, in a secure location, the following information (you&rsquo;ll need it soon):</p>
		<p>Domain Name:&nbsp;__________________________________</p>
			<p>Account Username:&nbsp;______________________________________</p>
			<p>Account Password:&nbsp; __________________________</p>
			<p>FTP Username:&nbsp; ______________________________ (if different from account username)</p>
			<p>FTP Password:&nbsp;_______________________________ (if different from account password)</p>
			<p>During the purchase process you may be presented with add-ons that the provider wants to sell you. You really don&rsquo;t need to buy anything other that your domain name and hosting. In addition, most providers will turn on the &ldquo;Auto Renew&rdquo; option. This means that when your domain name and/or hosting expire they will be automatically renewed and your payment method charged. If you don&rsquo;t want this, be sure to find and turn this option off.</p>

				<h2>Registering Your Domain for the Class</h2>

					<p>After acquiring your domain name and hosting account you must register with the professor. Visit the Site Registration page for directions.</p>
