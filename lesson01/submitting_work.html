		<h1>Submitting Work</h1>
		<dl>
			<dt><b>Q: How will I submit my work?</b></dt>
			<dd><b>A:</b> All work for this class is done and submitted to your own web site with the exception of the dynamic project proposal in lesson 07. Your web site is actually on what is referred to as a production server or in a production environment. You may see one of those terms used in directions for class assessments.</dd>

			<dd><b>A</b>: The dynamic project proposal in lesson 07 will submitted as a word processing document and submitted using I-Learn.</dd>

			<dt><b>Q: How will the professor or teaching assistant find my work to assess it?</b></dt>

			<dd><b>A:&nbsp;</b>There are several answers to this question depending on the type of assessment:
				<ol>
					<li>The person grading your work will always look for it on your web site.</li>
					<li>In Lesson 01, you will create an Exercises page and post it to your web site. This page will list all of the Chapter Exercises and Enhancements that you will be required to complete through the semester. Additionally, this Exercises page will be found via a link in the footer of your web site (remember footer modularization from CIT 230?).</li>
					<li>Chapter Exercises that DO NOT result in a working application:</li>
				</ol>
					<ul>
						<li>You will write a statement next to the exercise name in the Exercises page indicated if it was completed or not.</li>
						<li>Chapter Exercises that result in a working application will be posted to your web site and a link to the working application will be created in the Exercises page using the text for that Exercise that you created originally.</li>
						<li>Enhancements will be posted to your web site and a link to the Enhancement will be created in the Exercises page using the text for that Enhancement that you created originally.</li>
						<li>Exams will be posted to your web site using the directions provided in the exam.</li>
						<li>The Dynamic Project and video overview of the project will be posted to your web site and access to both must be obvious on the home page of your site.</li>
					</ul>
			</dd>

			<dt><b>Q: Since PHP code cannot be seen in a web browser, how will the grader know I did it?</b></dt>

			<dd><b>A:</b> All Enhancements, exams, and the Dynamic Project will require you to submit your code in a single zip file to a code submission dropbox. The particular dropbox for each item is found in the lesson folder where that assessment is due.</dd>

			<dt><b>Q: How will the grader see my database?</b></dt>

			<dd><b>A:</b> In some cases, the professor or teaching assistant may visit with you individually where you will be asked to show your database at that time. However, you more typically will be asked to export your database as a SQL file and include it with your code submission (this will be the case with the dynamic project).</dd>

			<dt><b>Q: In some of the lessons, I see the name of an Enhancement or exam listed more than once. Each one has a different number accompanying it. Why the duplicates?</b></dt>

			<dd><b>A:</b> Each number refers to a course objective. This class is graded based on demonstrated mastery of course objectives. In order for the I-Learn grade book to accept a score for each objective that a particular assessment may include, it requires a separate file. Furthermore, each file has to be visible to be active. We would hide them if we can, but we can&rsquo;t. When you open one, you will see a statement that tells you to complete the Exercise, Enhancement or exam and that the page is just a placeholder so the grade book can do its thing.</dd>

			<dt><b>Q: What if I have questions about completing or submitting an assessment?</b></dt>

			<dd><b>A:</b> Use the Discussion Boards (early) to ask your question because chances are that if you have a question, others will also have that same question. Then, when someone finds the answer and posts it, everybody now the answer. The professor will monitor the Discussion Board for each lesson, and if another student doesn&rsquo;t answer your question, the professor will, or you can always ask the professor or teaching assistant directly.</dd>

			<dt><b>Q: I see that I am encouraged to work with others on my Exercises and Enhancements. Why?</b></dt>

			<dd><b>A:</b> The number one skill we hear from our employers is that they want people who can work with others. You are still expected to pull your own weight or do your own work, but you have to be able to collaborate and communicate. By encouraging you to work together to solve the problems and build the necessary tools to complete the task, you learn how to successfully cooperate with other people.</dd>
