				<h1>Adding Yourself to the Student Site List</h1>
				<p>In order to gain access to your work it requires that your web site is easy to find. The same is true of everyone in the class. Go to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gpUP8WiJQdroemPxxVHHblllOEBBo2VK4GkP7IbRx6g/edit?usp=sharing" title="Open in a new tab" target="_blank">Student Site List</a> (a google spreadsheet) and enter your name in column A beneath the heading for the current semester.</p>

				<p>Once your name is in the cell, turn it into a hyperlink pointing to your website. You will need to provide a full path (e.g. http://mydomain.net). The directions to do this are shown below:</p>
				<h3>Create a Hyperlink</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Click on the cell to add the hyperlink</li>
					<li>From the Insert menu, select "Link"</li>
					<li>In the dialog box that opens enter the full address in the "Link" text box</li>
					<li>Click the "Apply" button</li>
					<li>When done, test the link by hovering over the link text and clicking the pop-up that appears near it</li>
					<li>Your page should open in a new tab</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>This is the place</h2>
				<p>When your site needs to be visited by another member of the class or by the professor or teaching assistant, this will be where we will go to do so. Make sure the link works and is accurate.</p>

				<h2>Editing the Link</h2>
				<p>If you ever need to update the link, simply click in the cell and repeat the step of creating the link, but making the adjustments to the URL as needed.</p>
