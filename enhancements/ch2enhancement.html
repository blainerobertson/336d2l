		<h1>Ch. 2 Enhancement</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>Each enhancement provides an opportunity to solve problems and apply the concepts covered in the current and previous week's topics.</p>

		<h2>Assumptions</h2>
		<p>This enhancement requires that you start where exercise 2-1 ended. It is anticipated that you will have completed the exercise on your own so that you are familiar with the application and how it operates. You can begin the enhancement by using the exercise solution code provided by the publisher, but using your own working code is encouraged.</p>

		<h2>Make a Copy</h2>
		<p>Prior to beginning the enhancement, make a copy of the finished exercise folder and paste it to a homework area in your site. Rename the pasted folder to represent the enhancement. Do all work on the enhancement in this location. Do NOT overwrite your chapter exercise doing the enhancement. Keep them separate.</p>

		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<p>The Ch. 2 enhancement requires you to further build the Product Discount application by adding two additional features:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Add PHP data validation for each of the inputs into the display_discount page. Display any errors that arise from the validation.</li>
			<li>Add a sales tax calculation of 8% based on the discounted price. Then, display the sales tax rate and the calculated sales tax amount after the discounted price. All of this work will be done in the display_discount page.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Build and test your code in the local development environment.</li>
			<li>Check your work to insure that it is operating correctly. Try submitting wrong data to make sure your validation picks it up and reports the error.</li>
			<li>When satisfied that the code is operational, upload the enhancement folder to the remote production server.</li>
			<li>Create a link from your exercises page to the index page in the enhancement folder and test that it works.</li>
			<li>Fully test the enhancement application for operation on the production server. Correct any errors that are found.</li>
			<li>When done, you should zip your enhancement folder and submit the zip file to the code submission dropbox in this week's module.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>All aspects of the solution are PHP-based: <b>3 points</b></li>
			<li>Each input (Product Description, List Price, Discount Percent) is checked and an appropriate error is displayed if wrong: <b>9 points - 3 points each</b></li>
			<li>Sales tax amount is 8% of the discount price and is displayed in the confirmation view: <b>3 points</b></li>
			<li>Final Display (when values are correct) includes all items shown below (values will depend on information entered): <b>6 points - 1 point each</b><br>

			<li>Total value: <b>22 points</b> - all in objective 2</li>
