		<h1>Ch. 13 Enhancement</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>Each enhancement provides an opportunity to solve problems and apply the concepts covered in the current and previous topics.</p>

		<h2>Assumptions</h2>
		<p>This enhancement builds upon chapter 12. The enhancement from chapter 12 is the starting point for this enhancement.</p>

		<h2>Make a Copy</h2>
		<p>You must have completed enhancement 12 so that you are familiar with the Future Value application and how it operates. <b>Make a copy of your chapter 12 enhancement folder and rename the copy to reflect that it is the chapter 13 enhancement. Do all work in the chapter 13 enhancement location.</b></p>

		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<p>You will rework the Future Value application by adding 3 custom functions to the application and applying them to the operation of the controller. The specific functions and what they do are described below:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Create a functions file in the folder where all three functions will be created, be sure to bring this file into scope within the controller to use the functions.</li>
			<li>Create a function to calculate the future value. This function should provide for compounding the interest on either a monthly or yearly basis. To do that, you can include a parameter for compounding the interest monthly that has a default value of FALSE.</li>
			<li>Create a second function to apply currency formatting to a value and use it with values before sending them to the view to be displayed.</li>
			<li>Create a third function to apply percent formatting to a value and use it with percentage values before sending them to the view to be displayed.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Build and test your code in the local development environment.</li>
			<li>Check your work to insure that it is operating correctly.</li>
			<li>When satisfied that the code is operational, upload the enhancement folder to the remote production server.</li>
			<li>Create a link from your exercises page to the index page in the enhancement folder and test that it works.</li>
			<li>Fully test the enhancement application for operation on the production server. Correct any errors that are found.</li>
			<li>When the enhancement is finished, tested and working, submit the controller and view to the code submission dropbox using the directions found there.</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The functions file exists: 2 points in objective 2</li>
				<li>The functions file is “in scope” of the controller: 3 points in objective 3</li>
				<li>The function to calculate future values works with either yearly or monthly compounding of interest and performs calculations correctly: 15 points in objective 2</li>
				<li>The currency formatting function works as required: 5 points in objective 2</li>
				<li>The percent formatting function works as required: 5 points in objective 2</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Enhancement Value</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Objective 2: 27 points</li>
				<li>Objective 3: 3 points</li>
			</ul>
