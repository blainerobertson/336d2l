				<h1>Ch. 12 Enhancement</h1>
				<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>Each enhancement provides an opportunity to solve problems and apply the concepts covered in the current and previous topics.</p>

				<h2>Assumptions</h2>
				<p>This enhancement requires your use of the chapter 7 enhancement as the starting point. You must have completed the chapter 7 enhancement so that you are familiar with the Future Value application and how it operates.</p>

				<h2>Make a Copy</h2>
				<p>Prior to beginning the enhancement, make a copy of the chapter 7 enhancement folder and paste it to a homework area in your site. Rename the pasted folder to represent the chapter 12 enhancement. Do all work on the enhancement in this location. Do NOT overwrite your chapter 7 enhancement doing this one. Keep them separate.</p>

				<h2>Tasks</h2>
				<p>You will rework the Future Value application by implementing a persistent session and storing values in it. The specific functionality to be built is described below:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Insure that the controller and all views have access to the session.</li>
					<li>Create a persistent session that will last for two weeks.</li>
					<li>Store the values from the Future Value input form into the session and populate the form with the values from the session when the page containing the form is loaded if there are values in the session, otherwise make the form inputs blank.</li>
					<li>The calculation capability of the application remains unchanged.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Submission</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Build and test your code in the local development environment.</li>
					<li>Check your work to insure that it is operating correctly.</li>
					<li>When satisfied that the code is operational, upload the enhancement folder to the remote production server.</li>
					<li>Create a link from your exercises page to the index page in the enhancement folder and test that it works.</li>
					<li>Fully test the enhancement application for operation on the production server. Correct any errors that are found.</li>
					<li>When done, you should zip your enhancement folder and submit the zip file to the code submission dropbox in this week's module.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The controller and view(s) have access to the session: 2 points in objective 2</li>
					<li>The session is persistent and limited to 2 weeks: 10 points in objective 2</li>
					<li>Data from the input form is stored in the session: 5 points in objective 2</li>
					<li>The input form fields are populated from the session data (if any) when loaded: 4 points in objective 2</li>
					<li>The application continues to work as expected: 5 points in objective 2</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Enhancement Value</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Objective 2: 26 points</li>
				</ul>
