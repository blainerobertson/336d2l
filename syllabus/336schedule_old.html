		<h1>CIT 336 Schedule</h1>
		<p>The course is divided into four units. Each unit focuses on related topics, has a number of readings, learning activities and assessments. Because this is a web development class, all assessments are submitted by being posted to your web site as specified in this schedule or individual assessment descriptions.</p>

		<p>Once posted, an assessment should remain unchanged until graded and the grade posted. The schedule below is a suggested schedule and you are free to move ahead if desired, however, the deadlines for assessments are firm.</p>
