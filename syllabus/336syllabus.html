		<h1>CIT 336 Syllabus</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>This course prepares students to plan, develop and construct dynamic web sites using HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL and MySQL databases. <b>This is a programming course, previous programming experience will be helpful.</b></p>

		<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
		<p>For success you will need the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A strong work ethic and the ability to solve problems and meet deadlines.</li>
			<li>The ability to work well with others - supporting, communicating, teaching and learning from them.</li>
			<li>A laptop computer with 8Gb or more of RAM (recommended), 64-bit fully threaded operating system and wireless capability.</li>
			<li>A domain name and web hosting that meets the following requirements:
				<ul>
					<li>linux based</li>
					<li>supports PHP 5.5 or higher</li>
					<li>supports sub-domains</li>
					<li>live customer support</li>

		</ul>
		<h2>Hosting</h2>
		<p>You are responsible for acquiring a domain name and professional web hosting from a provider of your choice. Previous students have had success with these companies: <a href='http://stats.justhost.com/track?c31b8be21a8ea1de7516b3cb569c3210e' title='Justhost.com site hosting'>JustHost.com</a>, <a href='http://www.hostmonster.com/track/blainerobertson/tellmemore?page=tell_me_more.html' title='Hostmonster.com site hosting'>Hostmonster.com</a> or <a href='http://www.bluehost.com/track/UP/BYUI' title='Bluehost.com site hosting'>Bluehost.com</a> (each of these hosting companies provide a free domain name with purchased hosting). I do not recommend the following host providers: Godaddy, Arvixe, IPage and Dreamhost. Hosting must be maintained for the duration of the course although most host providers will discount prices for longer sign-up periods.</p>

		<h2 id="objectives">Course Objectives</h2>
		<p>You will demonstrate both the knowledge and skills to create dynamic web sites using:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>principles introduced in Web Frontend Development - CIT 230;</li>
			<li>PHP â€” variables, arrays, functions and control structures;</li>
			<li>the Model-View-Control (MVC) design pattern to develop site applications;</li>
			<li>MySQL database(s) for storing data and SQL queries to carry out data interactions;</li>
			<li>data validation (client-side and server-side) appropriate to the task;</li>
			<li>problem solving through independent study, working effectively with others, communicating clearly, fulfilling assignments and meeting deadlines.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Philosophy</h2>
		<p>This course is another step to become a web developer - which requires you to both know and do. In order to know something you must study, reflect and practice. To do requires effort and application to implement your knowledge. This class requires both knowing and doing.</p>

		<p>Contrary to many classrooms where you work alone, this class <strong>strongly encourages</strong> you to work with others. You will form learning teams and these teams will be a primary source to turn to for help and feedback. However, ultimately <strong>YOU</strong> are responsible for your learning and for the results of your efforts.</p>

		<h2 id="summative">Assessments</h2>
		<p>Each listed assessment relates directly to one or more course objectives, indicated in brackets. Specific due dates are listed in the assessment document. All assessments will be posted to your own web site; once posted, an assessment should remain unchanged until the grade appears in the grade book. The professor, teaching assistant (TA) or peer(s) will grade each assessment, using a provided grading matrix.</p>

		<p>It is <strong>YOUR</strong> responsibility to thoroughly read and understand the specification for each assessment and <b>test</b> your own work prior to your work being graded. Self and peer reviews using the grading matrix prior to due dates is encouraged.</p>

		<h3>Teaching Presentation [Objectives 1 &amp; 6]</h3>
		<p>You will select one of the topics from the Teaching Presentation List and develop a 7-minute teaching presentation where you will teach others about the topic.</p>

		<p>The presentation must meet the following requirements:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The actual presentation will be an HTML5 video.</li>
			<li>The video will be within an HTML5 valid and semantic web page.</li>
			<li>The web page must be styled consistent with the other pages in your site and be valid CSS3.</li>
			<li>The page must have a clear topic title.</li>
			<li>The page must contain a written explanation of how the topic is implemented in web development.</li>
			<li>The web page must contain a working example of the topic.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Your teaching presentation page must be posted to your web site and a link to the teaching presentation must be placed in the page footer of all pages of the web site. The link must clearly identify that it leads to the teaching presentation. Carefully review the Teaching Presentation Grading Matrix.</p>

		<h3>Chapter Exercises [various]</h3>
		<p>The end of chapter exercises allow you to practice PHP concepts and skills from the chapters. Exercises and their due dates are noted in the schedule. Exercises are graded completed or not and each is worth 5 points for the objective as noted in the schedule. The exercises will be listed and accounted for in the exercises page of your site.</p>

		<h3>Chapter Enhancements [various]</h3>
		<p>Many chapters from the text involve an enhancement as well as an exercise. The Enhancements go beyond the exercises and require you to solve problems and demonstrate mastery of a variety of PHP concepts. The enhancements will be listed and links to each will be created in the exercises page of your site.</p>

		<h3>Unit Exam [All Objectives]</h3>
		<p>A unit exam will be given at the conclusion of unit 2 to assess your mastery of the basic concepts and techniques of PHP. The unit exam is an application exam requiring problem solving and writing code.</p>

		<h3>Dynamic Site Project [All Objectives]</h3>
		<p>You will produce a project of your own design to demonstrate your ability to implement the concepts and skills of this course into a live web site. Your project must be designed and submitted for approval to the professor as a proposal at the end of week 8. The finished project is due the last week of the semester as specified in the class schedule. This is a major element of the course. Read the dynamic project description and review the grading matrix.</p>

		<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
		<p>Grading in this course is competency based. This means that your grade is based on your <b>demonstrated competency of each course objective</b>. Each assessment is tied and scored directly to one or more course objectives.</p>

		<p>Your grade in the course is based on the number of course objectives of which you have demonstrated mastery. <b>Passing course objectives, not the gross percentage of the class, determines the final course grade.</b> Each objective is graded Pass / Fail. To pass an objective you must earn at least 80% of the points allocated to it. It is critical that you are always doing your best work, on time and error free &mdash; <b>Do not submit junk!</b></p>

		<h2>Course Grade Scale</h2>
		<table id='gradetable'>
			<tr>
				<th>Objectives Passed</th>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>0</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Grade Earned</th>
				<td>A</td>
				<td>B+</td>
				<td>B</td>
				<td>C+</td>
				<td>C</td>
				<td>D</td>
				<td>F</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h2>Warning</h2>
		<p><b>You must be self-motivation to succeed in this course.</b> There are expectations of constant learning and application &mdash; be anxiously engaged! Previous students have commented that you can do well in this course only if you stay caught up and work to grasp the concepts and apply them. Take their advice! <strong>It is expected that you will dedicate a minimum of 9 hours per week on this class. Do not plan less.</strong></p>

		<h2 id="help">Getting Help</h2>
		<p>Students frequently find that they need help and there are a number of ways of getting help: 1) your learning team, 2) the professor and 3) teaching assistants. It is not a matter of if, rather when, you will need help. Act quickly when you need help. Do NOT put it off!</p>
