				<h1>Import SQL File</h1>
				<p>After creating a database the next step is to create tables and fields, then populate the tables with data. While this can be done by hand, a much faster approach is to write scripts and store the scripts as SQL files. Then, these script files can be imported into the database and the server will automate the process. This is often the case when tables and data that are stored in one database need to be transferred to another database. The information can be exported as a SQL file from the current database, and then imported to the new database. Thus, saving time in the transferring of the database tables and data.</p>

				<p>This video demonstrates the process of importing a SQL file to create tables and populate them with data. Specifically, this will be useful for students working with data in exercises from the PHP and MySQL text of the CIT 336 course. The database being used in this video was shown being created in the <a href='remote_db.html' title='View the Create a remote database video' target="_blank">Create a Remote Database</a> video.</p>
